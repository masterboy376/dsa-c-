graphs:
-nodes: yhese are the states or vertex.
-edges: links between states in a graph.
  -undirected: two way edges.
  -directed: one way edges.

-representation:
  -adjacency matrix: 2d array where a[i][j]=1 if there is    an edge from i to j else a[i][j]=0.
  -adjacency list: array of list, where each a[i] is a       list of nodes x<i> that are reachable from i.

-searching:
  -depth first search:
  -breath first search:

-pre-order: first time when call comes on the node.
-in-order: when the call works inside the sebtree (in DFS 
 tree) of that node.
-post-order: after working on the subtree, call comes 
 back to the node. comes on the same node.
